# Fast Frames

Set up farcaster frames quickly without relying on thousands of node_modules and irrelevant bloat.

There are several libraries for making frames, most I have seen use Next.js, and all of them import a lot of unneccesary modules. This makes them slow, and increases the set-up difficulty by adding complexity and points of failure. Fast frames is a no-nonsense tool for setting up farcaster frames flaming fast.
